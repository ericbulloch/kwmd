Welcome! This is my personal repository for all things cyber security. I keep notes for commands that I regularly use and write ups for machines I have hacked on platforms like TryHackMe and VulnHub.

## Hacking Flow

I have been documenting the steps and scenarios that I often see in capture the flag events. I call this my [hacking flow](write_ups/flow.md). I use it as a reference and guide while I work on capture the flag events. My goal is for this to continue to evolve and become my one stop shop for bug bounties and capture the flag events.

## Tools

The tools folder contains a list of commands that I regularly use and most importantly examples of how they are used. Most of the tools come by default with Kali Linux.

## Write Ups

This `write_ups` folder contains folders for various platforms (i.e. TryHackMe, VulnHub, etc...). Inside those folders are the different boxes they provide that you can hack. In the write ups I provide the steps to get the answers but I usually will not give the actual answer. I also try to include what I am thinking and what commands I ran even if they didn't provide something that helped move forward. A lot of people who do write ups only include the answers and not all the steps they took to get those answers. The thought process is more important than the answers.
