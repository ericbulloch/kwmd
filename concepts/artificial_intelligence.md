# Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

I must talk about artificial intelligence as a tool. I will not go into large language models or deep learning. I think that other references can do a much better job with that than I can. I want to discuss what artificial intelligence can be used for with regards to cyber security and how to learn. I currently view it as a tool and nothing more. I don't believe the people out there that think it will remove jobs. I merely see it as something that will make you faster at your job.

## Learning Cyber Security

I have been utilizing AI in a number of ways as I have been learning cyber security. It has helped me learn concepts faster and provided feedback on ways that I can improve. What I like the most about the tool is that it is available when I need it.

I have used it to do the following:

- Explain broad cyber security concepts. This includes going into details on parts that do not make much sense or areas of a concept that I am very new to.
- Analyze results from tools to help show me what the output means. Each tool outputs things in different ways and having a tool that can provide feedback about the output has been very valuable for learning.
- Getting a different perspective. I am like any other person and I miss things. AI has been useful when I provide it with output from scans and my own analysis on the output regarding what steps I have done. AI has given me additional considerations that might yield good results. I don't know what I don't know and AI can show me areas that are a blind spot for me.
