# Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

I must talk about artificial intelligence as a tool. I will not go into large language models or deep learning. I think that other references can do a much better job with that than I can. I want to discuss what artificial intelligence can be used for with regards to cyber security and how to learn. I currently view it as a tool and nothing more. I don't believe the people out there that think it will remove jobs. I merely see it as something that will make you faster at your job.

## Learning Cyber Security

I have been utilizing AI in a number of ways as I have been learning cyber security. It has helped me learn concepts faster and provided feedback on ways that I can improve. What I like the most about the tool is that it is available when I need it.

I have used it to do the following:

- Explain broad cyber security concepts. This helps with understanding general ideas and then focusing on parts that are unfamiliar, unclear or new. This helps to personalize learning.
- Analyze results from tools to help show me what the output means. Each tool outputs things in different ways and having a tool that can provide feedback about the output has been very valuable for learning.
- Getting a different perspective. I am like any other person and I miss things. AI has been useful when I provide it with output from scans and my own analysis on the output regarding what steps I have done. AI has given me additional considerations that might yield good results. I don't know what I don't know and AI can show me areas that are a blind spot for me.
- A quiz game where the AI will generate a scenario that has an objective and provide me with clues within that scenario. I read the clues and try to pick what moves I should make next. The AI reviews what I decided and then it will let me know what I did right and what other things I should consider. I talk more about this in the quiz game section below.
- Generate scripts with vulnerabilities. I have used an AI to generate blocks of code that are vulnerable to attacks. This has been extremely beneficial to see both the red and blue side of cyber security.
- Explain malicious payloads. Sometimes the payloads can be a lot to take in and AI can break down the different parts very easily. If something is still unclear to me, I can have it further explain concepts so that I can more easily form connections between concepts.

### Quiz Game

As I have learned more and more about cyber security, I have come to realize the parts that I need to improve on. For example, I feel that I could be better at privilege escalation in Linux systems. This is something that I normally practice near the end of a capture the flag box in TryHackMe. So normally I have to compromise a web application and get a foothold on a server with remote code execution or a reverse shell. That can take a fair amount of time. I wanted to practice Linux privilege escalation without having to get to remote code execution or a reverse shell on a machine before I started.

This is where AI came into play. I expained to AI that I wanted to learn about privilege escalation and I wanted it to provide me with clues. I would then look at the clues and say what I think the next step is to obtain privilege escalation. AI would then look at my response and analyze both my answer and the logic I gave for going in that direction. AI would then provide feedback to let me know if I was on the right track, if I had the correct analysis or if I was way off. It provides feedback about what other kinds of things to look for and where I can improve.

## What I Don't Use It For

What you are not is just as important as what you are! I wanted to note a few things that I have not used AI for. I am not the guy that run all things through AI, I want to ask it specific questions because it currently does not do well understanding an entire process or a complete system. It is amazing at providing insights and analysis about parts of a system, but it struggles to explain the complex relationship between parts.

### Writing This Repository

The notes that I take for this repository are written by me. I do run it through AI from time to time to get feedback on writing style and other things. While I think that AI is very good at writing many things, the goal of this repository is to make my notes and talk about things that I have learned. If AI were to write this repository, I would have failed in what I was trying to do.

### Writing Commands

This might seem crazy to people but I am rarely have AI generate a command for me. I do have a list of commands in this repository that I regularly run that probably could be automated in some fashion. However, my goal is to learn and understand. I write out most of my commands to learn what the various switches and options do. I find that I am getting more comfortable with the tools and that I am able to quickly fix an issue if something goes wrong. I do from time to time, run commands through AI to ask if it is correct. I will also ask it for other considerations that I may have missed.

### Writing All Code

I have been a software developer for 15+ years. I enjoy it a lot and I also enjoy the challenge of solving some of the problems with code. There are some things that I like to write and there are things that I will ask the AI to write for me. My machine has a large collection of scripts that I have accumulated over the years that have worked out really well. For those reasons, I don't have AI write all the code.
