# Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

I must talk about artificial intelligence as a tool. I will not go into large language models or deep learning. I think that other references can do a much better job with that than I can. I want to discuss what artificial intelligence can be used for with regards to cyber security and how to learn. I view it as a tool and nothing more. I don't believe the people out there that think it will remove jobs. I merely see it as something that will make you faster at your job.
