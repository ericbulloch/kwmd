# Bash

Bash scripting is great. Bash scripting a really nice bonus that comes from using and understanding the Linux command line. It builds upon that Linux knowlege. There are common commands that a user or administrator will run often. A simple script can be made that will do a number of commands and automatically perform tasks.

Scripts can also serve as documentation for things that you know. What I mean by this, is that if there is a task that I have manually done over and over, I can write a script that performs each of the steps. The steps and commands are the documentation of what is being done and when. It can be helpful for new team members.

Since bash is running commands on a system it has most of the things that it requires. There might be binaries or other things that a script depends on but Bash is ubiquitious with Linux. Not all scripting languages are available on a fresh install of Linux. For example, Python and Perl are available on most Linux distros out of the box but Javascript (NodeJS), Typescript, Ruby, and Lua are not.
