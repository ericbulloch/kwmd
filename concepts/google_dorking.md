# Google Dorking

I have heard this called many things over the years. Some of them include Google fu, Google hacking and Consulting the oracle. The idea is that Google has already indexed website and if you know how to search with Google, you can find information that is publicly available.

Usually, a website will provide a robots.txt file that tells Google what folders it does not want indexed. In other words it is a black list of pages and links that the owner of a website doesn't want Google to show to the whole world. This is why I like to check the robots.txt file of a website, it lists all the pages that they don't want the public to know about.

## Operators

Google provides many operators to make searching more precise. There are operators that can remove results based on words or phrases. Search results can pertain to just a single or group of sites. Learning operators can make searching more enjoyable and help get answers faster.
