# Networking

How computer and systems connect is at the heart of cyber security. The scope of networking is massive and so I including items that I have found useful.

## TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the most common internet protocols. It used heavily with web browser applications like Chrome. It used for reliable transmission of data. It requires two computers to complete a three-way handshake before data begins to transfer.

TCP guarantees that all data packets are sent in the right order and without errors. If any packets are lost or corrupted, TCP will retransmit them. Some common protocols that care about data integrity are:

- HTTP and HTTPS: Browsing the web.
- FTP: Transferring files between machines.
- SMTP: Using email.

### TCP Three-Way Handshake

The three-way handshake is used by TCP to create a connection between two machines to let them know that data is about to be transmitted. Here is the ordering of the handshake:

- The sender sends a SYN (Synchronize) packet. The SYN packet lets the receiver know that the sender would like to synchronize a connection and the sender includes an initial sequence number.
- The receiver responds with a a SYN/ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) packet. The SYN/ACK packet lets the sender know that the receiver is ready for the communication.
- The sender sends a ACK (Acknowledge) packet. This is to let the receiver know that the sender got their SYN/ACK packet. This completes the handshake and a reliable connection is established.

## Ports

A computer can run multiple multiple applications at the same time. Any application that uses a network to send or receive data doesn't want to get another application's traffic. How does a computer do this? They use ports.

Each computer has 65,535 ports they can listen on. One application can listen on port 4444 and the traffic from another application listening on a different port doesn't interfer with the first application.
