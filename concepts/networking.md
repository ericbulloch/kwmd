# Networking

How computer and systems connect is at the heart of cyber security. The scope of networking is massive and so I including items that I have found useful.

## Ports

A computer can run multiple multiple applications at the same time. Any application that uses a network to send or receive data doesn't want to get another application's traffic. How does a computer do this? They use ports.

Each computer has 65,535 ports they can listen on. One application can listen on port 4444 and the traffic from another application listening on a different port doesn't interfer with the first application.
