# binwalk

Is a tool that looks at the binary of an image and detects embedded files and executable code. Its primary focus is firmware analysis but it works really well in capture the flag events for different image types.

## TryHackMe Attack Box

On the TryHackMe attack box, I have noticed that the binwalk command will generate the following error:

`AttributeError: module 'capstone' has no attribute 'CS_ARCH_ARM64'`

When this happens, I run the following command:

`sed -i 's/CS_ARCH_ARM64/CS_ARCH_AARCH64/g' /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/binwalk/modules/disasm.py`

[This fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/tryhackme/comments/1i8jj5f/comment/mcqjsir/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) solves the issue.

## Usage

Running `binwalk -h` provided the following output:

```bash

## Examples

The following examples are going to use a file called shady.jpg. This file has some files embedded into it.

### Find Known File Type

Binwalk has a large list of known file types that it checks for. Running the following command will have Binwalk check the image for the well known file types:

`binwalk -e shady.jpg`
