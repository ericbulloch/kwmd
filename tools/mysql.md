# mysql

Tool used to connect to MySQL instances to run queries and perform maintenance. I have included query examples here even though they are not specific to this tool.

## Examples

| Use Case | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Connect to local instance. | `mysql -u myUser -p` |
| Connect to remote instance. | `mysql -h 10.10.1.100 -u myUser -p` |
