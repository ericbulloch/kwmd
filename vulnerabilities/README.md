# Vulnerabilites

I have included different vulnerabilities here so that I can easily reference them and get inspiration while performing penentration tests. I am starting with the [OWASP Top Ten list for 2021](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## OWASP Top Ten

- [Broken Access Control](broken_access_control.md)
- [Cryptographic Failures](cryptographic_failures.md)
