# Cryptographic Failures

## What are Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic Failures are when a system (website, app, API, etc...) do not have sufficient cryptography measures in place to protect their sensitive data. This category used to be called Sensitive Data Exposure. It was changed because Cryptographic Failures are the root cause while Sensitive Data Exposure is the broad symptom.
