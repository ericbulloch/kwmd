# Identification and Authentication Failures

## What are Identification and Authentication Failures

This vulnerability refers to failures in verifying a user's identity and session integrity. If the controls that handle identification and authentication are weak, attackers can impersonate users, escalate privileges, hijack a current session, or takeover an account.

Imagine websites like lockers at school. Only people with the right key or combination (like a password) should be able to opent them. If the lock is weak or someone guesses the combo, they can sneak in.

## Common Examples

## Practice Exploiting Identification and Authentication Failures

### PortSwigger

PortSwigger has multiple labs to see this vulnerability in action. The labs are online and require an account. Here are some labs:

### OWASP Juice Shop

The OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source project that is intentionally vulnerable. It has many vulnerabilities and makes finding them a bit of a game using their scoreboard page. It can be accessed with Heroku or using Docker. I ran it using Docker and I seem to recall that one of the vulnerabilities will not work properly if you use Heroku. More information on the project and how to run it can [be found here](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).

### TryHackMe

TryHackMe has a couple rooms dedicated to this subject. The rooms are online and require an account. Here are some links to rooms that talk about Identification and Authentication Failures:
