### OWASP Juice Shop

The OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source project that is intentionally vulnerable. It has many vulnerabilities and makes finding them a bit of a game using their scoreboard page. It can be accessed with Heroku or using Docker. I ran it using Docker and I seem to recall that one of the vulnerabilities will not work properly if you use Heroku. More information on the project and how to run it can [be found here](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).

### TryHackMe
